# Control-Integrated-Simultaneous-Localization-and-Mapping
All code and simulations for the paper titled "Control-Integrated Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: Multi-Robot Coordination, Loop Closure Detection, and Dynamic Environment Adaptation". The paper has four phases.

Phase I establishes the mathematical foundation through a stochastic differential equation framework that couples robot dynamics with information-theoretic control objectives. The approach formulates control policies that explicitly balance exploration of unknown regions with exploitation of known landmarks for localization refinement, moving beyond traditional decoupled perception-control paradigms. The framework employs Extended Kalman Filter approximations for computational tractability while maintaining theoretical guarantees for convergence and consistency.

Phase II extends the single-robot framework to multi-robot distributed systems, developing scalable consensus algorithms that maintain map consistency under communication constraints and network topology variations. The distributed architecture incorporates consensus information filters, cross-correlation management through covariance intersection techniques, and Nash equilibrium-based coordination strategies that minimize exploration redundancy while ensuring connectivity. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence properties and provides robustness guarantees against Byzantine faults and network partitions.

Phase III addresses loop closure detection and place recognition through probabilistic validation frameworks that distinguish true revisits from false positives. The approach combines feature-based place recognition with sequential probability ratio tests, extending to multi-robot scenarios where robots must recognize locations previously visited by teammates. Graph-based map correction techniques efficiently propagate corrections while maintaining computational efficiency through incremental optimization methods.

Phase IV tackles dynamic environment adaptation by developing change detection algorithms that distinguish between transient disturbances and permanent environmental modifications. The framework incorporates multi-scale temporal modeling of landmark dynamics, adaptive map update strategies, and robust navigation policies that maintain safety while underlying map structures evolve. Statistical hypothesis testing frameworks detect environmental changes while temporal consistency constraints ensure map reliability.
